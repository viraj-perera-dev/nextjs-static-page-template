## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🔨 Build for Production

To generate a **fully static site**:

```bash
npm run build
# Output is saved in /out folder
```

You can now host the `/out` folder on any static hosting service (e.g., Hostinger, Register, Vercel, Netlify, etc..).

## 📦 Deploy

To deploy to Vercel (you have to be logged in before running this command):

```bash
npm vercel --prod
```

## 🧠 Metadata Helper

This template includes `components/Metadata.jsx`:

```js
import { generateSEOMetadata, generateStructuredData } from "@/components/Metadata";
```

Use it to inject:

* SEO titles and descriptions
* OpenGraph images
* Schema.org structured data (`WebPage`, `Article`, etc.)
